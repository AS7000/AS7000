## 🌟 **About Me**  
Hello there! I'm Mohamed, a motivated researcher, software engineer, and a self-proclaimed “AI whisperer.” With a passion for machine learning, deep learning, and photonic sensing, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and practicality. Whether it's creating cutting-edge solutions or debugging code at 2 AM, I bring enthusiasm and determination to every challenge.

> “Life is about turning 0 to 1”—and no, that's not binary, it’s my motto.
